self-guided-learning is a set of self-guided learning resources for readers beginning their computational biology journey.

## Usage

Computational biology approaches have become common in biological research, and an essential tool for many labs. Still, the complexity and ever changing nature of computational approaches can make learning to design, analyze, and interpret these data a daunting task.

While not exhaustive, weâ€™ve pulled together a set of self-guided learning resources for readers beginning their computational biology journey. Included are learning-oriented tutorials, task-oriented how-to guides, and information-oriented references. The formats vary from YouTube courses and MOOCs to website-based books and cheat-sheets.

## Contributing

Our goal is to create a useful resource that requires minimal searching/filtering to get started, but still up-to-date and comprehensive enough to be widely useful.

We welcome suggestions! Please open an issue first to discuss changes. :)
