### What is reproducibility?

Obtaining consistent results using the same data, computational methods, steps, code, and parameters.[1]


::: {.callout-tip}
Reproducibility is NOT the same as "repeatability" and "reusability", which are also quite important (See the table below).

Repeatability, replicatability, reproducibility, and reusability in science. [2]

### Defining Terms

There are many definitions of repeatability, replicatability, and reproducibility -- some are quite conflicting. For our purposes, we'll stick with the terms as outlined in the table below.

+------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Metric                       | Repeatability | Replicatability | Reproducibility | 
+==============================+===============+=================+=================+
| Operator -- Who performs it? | Same lab      | Others          | Others          |
+------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Input                        | Same          | Same            | Same-ish        |
+------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Methods                      | Same          | Same            | Same-ish        |
+------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| Outcome -- Results?          | Same          | Same            | Consistent      |
+------------------------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+

### Why do it?

- Scientific responsibility
- Increased acceptance and validation of your work
- Time savings
- Collaborative benefits

### Reproducbility Crisis

I'm sure this isn't news to anyone that has tried to reproduce results from other labs, but there is a reproducibility crisis. The situation is no different for computational analyses.

Results when 1576 research scientists were asked if there was a reproducibility crisis. [3]

### Barriers to Reproducibility

There are many barriers to reproducbility, highlighted in the figure and table below.

::: {#fig-reproducibility-barriers}
![](/images/barrier-to-reproducibility.jpg)

Barriers to reproducibility can often be hidden and seem daunting. [4]
:::

+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| Factors         | Examples                                 |
+=================+==========================================+
| Human           | - Poor documentation                     |
|                 | - Confirmation bias                      |
|                 | - Working in silos                       |
|                 | - Random errors, despite best intentions |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| Technical       | - Variability                            |
|                 | - Reagents                               |
|                 | - Lack of tools                          |
|                 | - Atypical nature of work                |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+
| Institutional   | - Lack of rewards                        |
|                 | - Lack of lab buy-in, support            |
|                 | - Paywalls                               |
+-----------------+------------------------------------------+

We can classify the above barriers issues in one or more of the following areas
 - Organization
 - Documentation
 - Automation
 - Dissemination

In the next section we will learn about some things we can do to overcome these barriers.
