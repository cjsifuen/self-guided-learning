Computational biology approaches have become common in biological research, and an essential tool for many labs. Still, the complexity and ever changing nature of computational approaches can make learning to design, analyze, and interpret these data a daunting task. On this page, we will have curated lists of resources aimed at reducing that burden and provide computational training in various areas, including, but not limited to:

- online tutorials (videos and otherwise) and courses
- tool recommendations and descriptions
